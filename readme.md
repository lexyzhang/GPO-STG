Geographical Process-Object SpatioTemporal Graph (GPO-STG) Framework

Overview

The Geographical Process-Object SpatioTemporal Graph (GPO-STG) framework is a novel approach for modeling and analyzing continuous land surface changes from remote sensing time series (RSTS) data. By integrating spatiotemporal segmentation, graph-based modeling, and multilevel analysis, this framework provides a robust tool for understanding complex geographical processes.





Spatiotemporal Segmentation: Segments RSTS data into spatiotemporal cubes based on heterogeneity thresholds.

Graph Construction: Builds a spatiotemporal graph (GPO-STG) to represent relationships between geographical process-objects (GPOs).

Multilevel Analysis: Supports node-level, edge-level, subgraph-level, and global-level analysis.
